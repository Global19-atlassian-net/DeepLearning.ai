### A short Note:- ###
I am currently doing the fourth course of the specialization. I would add the code base and quiz answers for the same as soon as I am finished with it. Please keep in mind that these assignment and quiz solutions are **only for your reference**. Use these  when you get stuck for a long time. The assignments and quizzes are relatively easy if you can grasp the material well.  If you copy/paste the assignments , it would be deemed as cheating, and that is a violation of [Coursera's Honor Code](https://www.coursera.org/about/terms/honorcode). You wouldn't want to do that!

All the best and happy learning. :)
